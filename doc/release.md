The builds (*unsigned*) works for Windows XP and above. CPU support for SSE2 (Pentium 4) is required for Win32 build, for old CPU and system see wiki [Build Notepad2](https://github.com/zufuliu/notepad2/wiki/Build-Notepad2). The AVX2 build works for Windows 7 SP1 (or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1) and above (64-bit only), requires CPU support for [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) and [POPCNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_Manipulation_Instruction_Sets).

Since v4.19.01r1786, latest development build (artifacts in Release configuration for each compiler and platform) can be downloaded from https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zufuliu/notepad2

Tips: To keep your current settings, do NOT replace *Notepad2.ini* or *metapath.ini* or any theme files with the bundled one, but please mind the breaking changes in [v4.19.01r1786](https://github.com/zufuliu/notepad2/releases/tag/v4.19.01r1786) and below when upgrading to this version from versions before v4.19.01r1786.
